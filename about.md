I do bioinformatics in the [CeMEB](http://www.cemeb.science.gu.se/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cemeb.science.gu.se%2Fcemeb_sv%2F) research platform at the [Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences](http://bioenv.gu.se/), University of Gothenburg. Also teaching, mainly UNIX and phylogenetics. 

### More Information

A common theme of my research projects is the evolution of chloroplasts, and I am particularly interested in the evolution of the two protein complexes “Translocons at the Outer and Inner Chloroplast envelope membranes” (TOC and TIC respectively). These protein complexes transport nuclear-encoded proteins into the chloroplast, and the evolution of TOC/TIC is an important part of the transformation of the ancient cyanobiont into a modern chloroplast. 

I am also interested in how science is conducted and displayed (e.g. Open data and Open access publishing), and I have started documenting my research in an open laboratory notebook that can be found here (first entry posted 2011-06-12). I'm still exploring the opportunities of open notebook science (ONS), why early entries in my notebook looks quite different from later once. 

In the past, I was hooked on restoring vintage Land Rover cars, preferably the [serie IIa model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rover_Series#Series_IIA), but lately I find it more convenient, and equally rewarding to tinker with old computer hardware.
