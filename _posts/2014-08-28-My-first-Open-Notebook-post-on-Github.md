title: My first Open Notebook post on Github
published: true
---

I have been getting more and more frustrated about using [my drupal powered site](http://matstopel.se) for my open notebook (the page functionallity is not yet fully recovered from the last failed upgrade attempt of Drupal) and have therefore looked for other options to use. We are regularly using Google docs for semi-open notebooks i the lab, but that solution does not really provide the flexibility I'm looking for. I was therefore very exited to find [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and will try this out for a while to see how it goes. Idealy I would like to build an open notebook template that students and collaborators can clone and use on their own. I'm an absolute beginner at [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and have never used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or the [Liquid templating language](http://liquidmarkup.org/) before, so if anybody has any suggestion or whould like to contribute, [just let me know.](mailto:info@matstopel.se)
